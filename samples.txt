I've been having severe headaches and blurry vision for the past two days.

I feel extremely tired and have a sore throat.

I've been experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath since yesterday.

My stomach has been upset with frequent vomiting and diarrhea.

I have a persistent cough and a fever that won't go away.

I've been feeling abdominal pain and bloating after meals.

My joints have been hurting and swollen, especially in the mornings.

I've developed a rash on my arms and it's extremely itchy.

Lately, I've been feeling dizzy and lightheaded when I stand up quickly.

I've been urinating more frequently and feeling unusually thirsty throughout the day.
